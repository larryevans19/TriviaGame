# TECH TRIVIA TIME
Prepare to test your Georgia Tech sports trivia knowledge in **TECH TRIVIA TIME**.  This timed trivia challenge presents questions in which the player has 10 seconds to answer, with the added flavor of college football themed scoring.  The game takes place on a vintage college football JUMBOTRON.  And just like college football, in **TECH TRIVIA TIME** the clock can be your friend or your enemy.  Correctly answer a question with 4 or more seconds remaining on the clock and you'll score a touchdown (7 points) for the Yellow Jackets!  Answer correctly with less than 4 seconds remaining and you earn a field goal (3 points) for Tech.  But watch out, because if you live by the clock, you can also die by the clock.  Fail to answer a question before time expires, or incorrectly answer a question too soon (with 4 or more seconds) remaining on the clock, and Tech's arch rival UGA scores a touchdown.  Incorrectly answer a question with less than 4 seconds remaining and the Dawgs get a field goal.  At the end of 4 quarters of action (each quarter consists of 2 questions), the scoreboard will determine if the Jackets come out on top, or if the player needs to hit the record books!  It's **_TIME!_**
